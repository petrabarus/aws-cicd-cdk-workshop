### Chapter 1

# Setting Up Environment

In this chapter you will set up environment by creating a new AWS Cloud9 Development Environment and make sure the environment is suitable for our development. AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects.
